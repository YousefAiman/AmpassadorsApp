The Palestinian issue is directed by a set of internal and external dangers and threats that require providing the requirements for national revival, according to an integrated roadmap that guarantees the realization of reshaping the Palestinian strategic direction based on the link between the gains achieved by the Palestinian peoples struggle on the one hand, and its national goals on the other hand, in a way that enables the Palestinians to achieve The various groupings from re-seizing the initiative in the context of a cumulative process of transforming challenges into opportunities, by focusing on bringing about a change in the balance of power that serves the national liberation struggle of the Palestinian people, and adhering to the Palestinian historical narrative and the discourse of national and legal rights for the Palestinian people, including the project to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Without ignoring the defense of the individual and collective rights of the Palestinians wherever they are in historic Palestine and the diaspora, which requires the Palestinian leadership to take a historic position through a rapid and without delay approach to turn the page on the internal division in the Palestinian body as a whole, and to strive for real and serious restoration of national unity; This will contribute to providing the most important requirements for addressing national challenges and risks

What this requires from the start is one of the most important national priorities that require the elevation of all national and societal in the various Palestinian communities to the level of moral, legal and revolutionary national responsibility alike, in order to work according to the roadmap proposed by the national movement, which is based on:
First: Adopting clear, publicized, and participatory policies aimed at thwarting Israeli-American plans, and on top of these policies is the serious pursuit of changing and rebuilding the political system, restoring Palestinian national unity on the basis of partnership and the agreements that have been expected, and abandoning Palestinian divisions of many forms.
Second: Reforming the Liberation Organization and seeking to establish a Palestinian political system that represents everyone, away from factional quotas. It is based on democratic foundations governing all its components (organization and authority), which must be re-activated and unified to ensure individual and public freedoms and rights, embody partisan and political pluralism, separate powers and their independence, the rule of law, and ensure national consensus and partnership on the basis of the common national program.
Third: Forming a national unity government after the legislative and presidential elections and ensuring work to put in place the electoral process after providing all guarantees of its success in the context of liberation from occupation, and conducting elections for the National Council on objective foundations and criteria agreed upon and ensuring the representation of all Palestinian groupings and sectors, while ensuring that elections are free and fair. Respecting its results, and conducting them at all local and public levels and in all sectors and institutions.


Third: Establishing the decisions of the Palestinian National Council; The actual place of implementation, reviewing the form of authority, its functions and obligations, and the transfer of the political missions of power to the organization,
Fourth: Work to strengthen the steadfastness of the Palestinians, including adopting the policies of resilience and development of emancipation, maximizing investment in the Palestinian people, technical and vocational education, establishing banks to support the poor, business incubators for the youth and the unemployed, promoting agricultural and industrial production, and pressuring to lift collective penalties on the Gaza Strip, reducing taxes, and providing support to citizens in various countries. Their gatherings, good management of resources and aid fairly, strengthening popular oversight, stopping intrusions on rights and freedoms, and mobilizing the energies of the Palestinian people so that they can face the imminent national and humanitarian risks surrounding the issue and the Palestinian people.

Fifth: Consolidating and activating Palestinian diplomacy in a way that guarantees restoring the Palestinian issue on the ladder of priorities of Arab and international issues, investing Palestine’s membership in regional and international organizations to expose Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people and their war occupied land, and contributing to stopping Israeli-American incitement speech against the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees UNRWA), and against the work of the Permanent Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and against international and regional financing institutions that support the Palestinian people, in particular the European Union.
Sixth: Employing international, Arab and regional variables in favor of the Palestinian cause and distancing Palestinian positions and policies from any of the Arab, regional and international axes, adopting a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of Arab and non-Arab countries, protecting the Palestinian front from external interference, and restoring the status of the Palestinian cause as a cross-cutting issue, It should remain so without being part of any axis, and reinforce the identity and role of the various Palestinian forces as part of the Palestinian national liberation movement, far from an organizational, ideological or political association with external parties.
Eighth: Activating popular resistance and maximizing the popular, diplomatic, legal and media clash with the occupation, adopting the movement to boycott Israel and divesting investments from it, calling on world countries to impose sanctions on Israel, refer files of war crimes and crimes against humanity, to the International Criminal Court and using the principle of international jurisdiction and activating opinion The consultant to the Court of Justice in The Hague, and to turn again to the International Court of Justice to extract more decisions in favor of the Palestinian cause and to activate the international and regional mechanisms condemning the exposure of the crimes of the occupation and requesting international protection for the Palestinian people, including inviting the states party to the Geneva Conventions to convene.

Ninth: To crystallize a global front that includes various international blocs and forces, friendly countries, the forces of global public opinion supporting our cause, and the various United Nations institutions, to support the program of ending occupation, settlement, return and national independence, in a way that strengthens the Palestinian effort to build a political wall of confrontation in the face of the American plan. The basis for crystallizing an international position that adheres to international law and United Nations resolutions, in a manner that guarantees the empowerment of the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate national rights, declaring the state of Palestine under occupation and holding the countries of the world responsible for the daily violations and crimes committed by the occupying power, and calling on the international community and international organizations to take serious action to end the occupation and lift the blockade Imposed on the Gaza Strip, stopping the colonial settlement crimes, racial discrimination and judaizing the city of Jerusalem, and guaranteeing the right of return for Palestinian refugees in accordance with Resolution 194, in a manner that guarantees an end to the continued suffering of the Palestinian people.
Tenth: Implement transitional justice, reunify and activate all official, union and popular Palestinian institutions to play their role in protecting the rights of victims of division, ensuring rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary, fighting corruption, and providing opportunities to enhance the status of women, youth, children and people with disabilities.

Workers and the poor, responding to their needs, ensuring respect for their rights, enhancing their participation in decision-making positions, stopping forms of discrimination and marginalization of their rights, and working to stop the collapse, combating poverty, providing job opportunities, economic growth and improving social and economic conditions.

The imminent dangers and national and humanitarian challenges place upon the Palestinians to work towards building a national democratic current and public opinion that includes everyone who believes in the necessity of adopting a national roadmap for the advancement and national action, through the concerted efforts of all the various actors and actors in the Palestinian political, popular and societal milieus. Especially the youth in the homeland and diaspora, towards providing the conditions for the growth of a national democratic current that presses for a path capable of change and restoration of national unity on the basis of partnership, national consensus and the rule of law, restoring the status of the Palestinian cause, strengthening the struggle for national and democratic liberation, protecting rights and freedoms, and promoting social justice and dignity for citizens .
